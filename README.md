# didiBot
Discord bot written with python and using discord.py. Connects even to mysql db. Ultimate goal would be to control a GT fusion reactor with the help of Open Computers. Meanwhile I use it for expermineting and meming around. Feel free to search for examples of discord.py stuff. Also don't hesitate to ping me/create an issue if you have any questions.
