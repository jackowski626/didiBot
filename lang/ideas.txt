- roulette, and vs roulette with points
- the roulette gives a role that limits typing and speaking. It would be funny to move such a person to an empty voice channel
	if she connects to one with people and move her again if ppl join. If all channels are taken, just yeet the person.
- make a "subscribe" command which will send an embed each time a subbed channel uploads. If someone reacts with an
	emote to the embed, the bot sends the video in pm
- there should be a command for changing language but it should also work with an emoji
- there should be some fake languages (twomad babaou) or languages modifiers (like uwu)
